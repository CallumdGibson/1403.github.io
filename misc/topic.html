            <h1>YouTube and its Effects on Children</h1>
            <h2>Chosen Technology/Topic</h2>
            <h4>The page or area describing your chosen technology/topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.</h4>

            <p>YouTube is an online video-sharing platform founded in 2005 that quickly rose to popularity in usage among people all over the world due to its easy accessibility and various uses for it. Content uploaded to YouTube covers a broad range of topics – from educational topics, to entertainment in the forms of skits, gaming, and animation. But as convenient and expressive as this concept of sharing videos is, YouTube is ultimately a money-making machine designed to hook their users into the endless cycle of watching videos. In fact, children under 8 years old spend 65% of their time online watching YouTube (Tahir, R., Ahmed, F., Saeed, H., Ali, S., Zaffar, F., & Wilson, C., 2019, August). Young children are already infatuated with this video-sharing platform.</p>
            <p>From this, the effects of the regular usage of YouTube are questioned. Which audience is more affected by the consequences of YouTube? Do the risks of watching YouTube outweigh the benefits? How much impact does it actually have? Specifically, how impactful are the consequences of YouTube for young children, given that children begin to show signs of moral awareness as early as 17-18 months (Lamb, S., 1993)?</p>
            <p>With all these questions in mind, this article will discuss the impacts of YouTube on children and its opportunities, risks, choices and ethics. Is YouTube able to create a more positive environment for children, or will it continue to be a possible barrier for a child’s development in the future if nothing is done?</p>
