        </center>
            <p>Although YouTube has quite a negative reputation among scholars, some scholars have also argued that there some benefits to YouTube for children. 
              A positive opportunity presented by YouTube are the educational videos shared on the platform, all within access for people of all ages. And best of all, 
              these educational resources are free to watch! YouTube as an educational resource has attracted academic researchers and scholars to determine the validity 
              of using YouTube for these purposes. In fact, there have been thirty-five published researches from 2008 to 2015 (Snelson 2016) about YouTube used in the 
              classroom. Educational YouTube videos have been categorised into two groups: curating existing videos, and hosting videos. The benefit of easy access and 
              free-to-share educational topics to the public via YouTube videos explains the interest of this video-sharing platform popular for kids who want additional 
              help outside of class. </p>

            <p>In addition to that, educational video topics can also provide exposure to real-life problems. Many campaigns and movements have been hosted on YouTube 
              due to YouTube’s viral tendencies. In a way, this can be an opportunity for the audience, given the message(s) promoted are positive. For example, body-wellness 
              and mental health videos on YouTube can help children realise the importance of maintaining health physically and mentally. This could encourage children to try 
              developing healthier habits regarding that educational topic. No doubt, these opportunities from YouTube makes the validity of using it more appealing.</p>
            <p>Alongside the risk YouTube being a potentially dangerous platform to view online personas, there is an opportunity for children to develop a “sense of 
              community” within YouTube. From an analysis about the YouTube community conducted by Rotman, D., Golbeck, J. and Preece, J. (2009), participants have agreed that 
              “YouTube is a social space that offers the conditions needed to cultivate a community, such as emotional support, joint interests and communal culture.” 
              Essentially, YouTube is a meeting place to create and meet friends. Online friends have become more popular throughout the years, especially because of how 
              accessible it is to go online and easily connect with like-minded people on these worldwide social platforms. The appeal of having online friends is heightened, 
              and to some, it can be preferable to communicate with others online due to the diversity of the online community. While having ‘real-life’ friends is always good, 
              choosing to make online friends can broaden one’s perspective of things, seeing as the online community comes from a view of different cultures. In essence of 
              this, the opportunity presented given the interaction on YouTube for children is that it gives children some sense of belonging at an early age and may, to an 
              extent, develop social skills that can be taken to either of the online or ‘real-life’ community.</p>
            <p>As well as that, there is also the opportunity of good influencers on YouTube. Some content creators use their platform to communicate uplifting messages 
              to their audience, where the audience is also encouraged to reverberate this message onto others. This influence may benefit children in that children will 
              begin to differentiate the concepts of positive behaviour and negative behaviour, and most importantly, the consequences of acting on these behaviours. Positive 
              behaviour is rewarded, and children would see this with a content creator’s success and strong support for them. On the other hand, negative behaviour is 
              punished, and children would see this with a content creator’s mostly negative feedback on their content and lack of support. Although it may not always be 
              this case where consequences are fairly served, it still provides a meaning to children regarding the justice given to positive and negative behaviour.</p>
            <p>YouTube gives plenty of exposure to people, whether the exposure is intentional or not. Despite the risk of exposure of inappropriate content towards children, 
              there is an opportunity for children to gain exposure as a ‘YouTuber’ and starting a career early. Even as early as 9! The biggest-paid YouTuber is nine-year-old 
              Ryan Kaji, who in 2020, earned $29.5 million in revenue (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2020/12/18/the-highest-paid-youtube-stars-of-2020/?sh=1c9f2e3b6e50">Forbes</a>). 
              Children aspiring to be YouTubers may not all become like Ryan Kaji, but YouTube can certainly give exposure and provide connections to YouTubers. The 
              reason why being a YouTuber is becoming a popular career option for people is because YouTube has no age on who is eligible to be a YouTuber. There are 
              many young YouTubers as there are old YouTubers. This can be helpful for those who want to start a career at their own pace. YouTube has no set target 
              market either, so users can begin a YouTube career from promoting their music to sharing entertainment with others.</p>

             <p>If being a public figure is not appealing to the interested user, there are other skills that can be developed from a video-sharing career such as 
              video-editing and music-making etc. People can get paid to edit videos or to use their content (like music or animations) for someone’s videos. While 
              sticking to the YouTube side of their career may be ideal to some, others could also transfer their video-making skills for more traditional careers like 
              videographers, TV/film editors, or film music composers. With this opportunity for children, they are shown a broad range of career options with lots of 
              potential.</p>
