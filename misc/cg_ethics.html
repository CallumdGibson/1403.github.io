            <p>
              I believe there are many ethical implications to be had in regard to YouTube, especially when talking about how it affects children. 
              We live in a time where the ability to voice your own opinion is easier than ever. Everyone should be allowed to have their own voice, however the 
              issue in regards to YouTube is it allows opinions to be shared much easier, and can be used to persuade all people, but especially children, to 
              think differently. It can be used to tell children that something is the right thing to do, when in reality it is not. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Watching YouTube creators can trick children into thinking that the creator cares about them, or even just knows who they are. There are many children 
        who go online to watch a streamer or content creator, and the line between entertainer and friend gets blurred, so the children think they are closer 
        than they really are. This can lead to heartbreak when the creators either never acknowledge them, or they tell them that they do not care about them 
        the same way the child thinks about the creator. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I believe that anyone creating content on YouTube is an entertainer, and due to that fact, there is always going to be that blurred line where a viewer 
        thinks they know a lot more about the creator. Children are the most susceptible to these kind of relationships, and I do not believe YouTube will be able 
        to fix this. Parents need to sit their children down and have a conversation with them, explaining that online personalities are there to entertain, and 
        are not there to make friends. It needs to become the new normal when raising children to explain the internet personalities, and explain these points to 
        them at a young age. It is unavoidable in a lot of cases though, as children are always going to feel close to someone if they feel like the creator cares 
        about them.
